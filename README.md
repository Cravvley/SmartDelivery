App concept!

In the era of the current pandemic, access to stationary services to which the gray Smith was accustomed has been hampered. Faced with this problem, I propose to create an application to manage the ordering of food from restaurants. The purpose of this application will be to provide the user with an interface through which he will be able to order for himself any product from any restaurant through the described application, which makes the delivery of goods available in a simple and intuitive way. The project will be implemented with the help of Microsoft technology, namely using the .net core MVC framework, this will allow to quickly achieve a satisfactory result and provide convenience for the programmers taking an active part in the project. Among other things, the application will be based on n-layer architecture, the back-end will be created using c# language and the front-end will be based on Bootstrap css library.
